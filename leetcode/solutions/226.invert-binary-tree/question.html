<p>Invert a binary tree.<br>     4<br>   /   \<br>  2     7<br> / \   / \<br>1   3 6   9</p>
<p>to<br>     4<br>   /   \<br>  7     2<br> / \   / \<br>9   6 3   1</p>
<p>Trivia:<br>This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:<br>Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.</p>
