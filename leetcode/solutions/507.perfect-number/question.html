<p>We define the Perfect Number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of all its positive divisors except itself. </p>
<p>Now, given an integer n, write a function that returns true when it is a perfect number and false when it is not.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Input: 28<br>Output: True<br>Explanation: 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14</p>
<p>Note:<br>The input number n will not exceed 100,000,000. (1e8)</p>
