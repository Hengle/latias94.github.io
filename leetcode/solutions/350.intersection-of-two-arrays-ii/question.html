<p>Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.</p>
<p>Example:<br>Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2, 2].</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.<br>The result can be in any order.</p>
<p>Follow up:</p>
<p>What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?<br>What if nums1’s size is small compared to nums2’s size? Which algorithm is better?<br>What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?</p>
