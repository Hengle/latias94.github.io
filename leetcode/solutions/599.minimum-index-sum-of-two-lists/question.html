<p>Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings. </p>
<p>You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Input:<br>[“Shogun”, “Tapioca Express”, “Burger King”, “KFC”]<br>[“Piatti”, “The Grill at Torrey Pines”, “Hungry Hunter Steakhouse”, “Shogun”]<br>Output: [“Shogun”]<br>Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is “Shogun”.</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p>Input:<br>[“Shogun”, “Tapioca Express”, “Burger King”, “KFC”]<br>[“KFC”, “Shogun”, “Burger King”]<br>Output: [“Shogun”]<br>Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is “Shogun” with index sum 1 (0+1).</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>The length of both lists will be in the range of [1, 1000].<br>The length of strings in both lists will be in the range of [1, 30].<br>The index is starting from 0 to the list length minus 1.<br>No duplicates in both lists.</p>
