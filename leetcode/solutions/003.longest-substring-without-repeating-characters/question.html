<p>Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Given “abcabcbb”, the answer is “abc”, which the length is 3.</p>
<p>Given “bbbbb”, the answer is “b”, with the length of 1.</p>
<p>Given “pwwkew”, the answer is “wke”, with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, “pwke” is a subsequence and not a substring.</p>
