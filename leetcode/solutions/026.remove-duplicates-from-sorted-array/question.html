<p>Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.</p>
<p>Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Given nums = [1,1,2],</p>
<p>Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.<br>It doesnâ€™t matter what you leave beyond the new length.</p>
