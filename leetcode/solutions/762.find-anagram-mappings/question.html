<p>Given two lists Aand B, and B is an anagram of A. B is an anagram of A means B is made by randomizing the order of the elements in A.</p>
<p>We want to find an index mapping P, from A to B. A mapping P[i] = j means the ith element in A appears in B at index j.</p>
<p>These lists A and B may contain duplicates.  If there are multiple answers, output any of them.</p>
<p>For example, given</p>
<p>A = [12, 28, 46, 32, 50]<br>B = [50, 12, 32, 46, 28]</p>
<p>We should return</p>
<p>[1, 4, 3, 2, 0]</p>
<p>as P[0] = 1 because the 0th element of A appears at B[1],<br>and P[1] = 4 because the 1st element of A appears at B[4],<br>and so on.</p>
<p>Note:<br>A, B have equal lengths in range [1, 100].<br>A[i], B[i] are integers in range [0, 10^5].</p>
