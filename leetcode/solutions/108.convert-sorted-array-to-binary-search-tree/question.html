<p>Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.</p>
<p>For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],</p>
<p>One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:</p>
<pre><code> 0
/ \
</code></pre><p>   -3   9<br>   /   /<br> -10  5</p>
