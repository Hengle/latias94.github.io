<p>Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.</p>
<p>Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.</p>
<p>The order of elements can be changed. It doesnâ€™t matter what you leave beyond the new length.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,</p>
<p>Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.</p>
