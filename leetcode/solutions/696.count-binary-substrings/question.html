<p>Give a string s, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that have the same number of 0’s and 1’s, and all the 0’s and all the 1’s in these substrings are grouped consecutively. </p>
<p>Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Input: “00110011”<br>Output: 6<br>Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1’s and 0’s: “0011”, “01”, “1100”, “10”, “0011”, and “01”.<br>Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.<br>Also, “00110011” is not a valid substring because all the 0’s (and 1’s) are not grouped together.</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p>Input: “10101”<br>Output: 4<br>Explanation: There are 4 substrings: “10”, “01”, “10”, “01” that have equal number of consecutive 1’s and 0’s.</p>
<p>Note:<br>s.length will be between 1 and 50,000.<br>s will only consist of “0” or “1” characters.</p>
