<p>Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, two’s complement method is used.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.<br>The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character ‘0’; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.<br>The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.<br>You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Input:<br>26</p>
<p>Output:<br>“1a”</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p>Input:<br>-1</p>
<p>Output:<br>“ffffffff”</p>
