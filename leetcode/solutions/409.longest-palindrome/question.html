<p>Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.</p>
<p>This is case sensitive, for example “Aa” is not considered a palindrome here.</p>
<p>Note:<br>Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p>Input:<br>“abccccdd”</p>
<p>Output:<br>7</p>
<p>Explanation:<br>One longest palindrome that can be built is “dccaccd”, whose length is 7.</p>
