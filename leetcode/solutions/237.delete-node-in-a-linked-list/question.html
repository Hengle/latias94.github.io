<p>Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.</p>
<p>Supposed the linked list is 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4 after calling your function.</p>
