<p>Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.</p>
<p>For example, the following two linked lists: </p>
<p>A:          a1 → a2<br>                   ↘<br>                     c1 → c2 → c3<br>                   ↗<br>B:     b1 → b2 → b3</p>
<p>begin to intersect at node c1.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.<br>The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.<br>You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.<br>Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.</p>
