<p>Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.</p>
<p>You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.</p>
<p>For example,<br>Given 1-&gt;4-&gt;3-&gt;2-&gt;5-&gt;2 and x = 3,<br>return 1-&gt;2-&gt;2-&gt;4-&gt;3-&gt;5.</p>
